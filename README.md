# Install & Upgrade

```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adelrz/Server-Proxy/master/install.sh)
```

## Manual install & upgrade

1. First download the latest compressed package from https://github.com/adelrz/Server-Proxy/releases, generally choose the `amd64` architecture
2. Then upload the compressed package to the `/root/` directory of the server, and use the `root` user to log in to the server

> If your server cpu architecture is not `amd64`, replace `amd64` in the command with another architecture

```
cd /root/
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/
mv x-ui/ /usr/local/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x-ui
systemctl restart x-ui
```

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

## SSL Certificate application

> This function and tutorial are provided by [FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)

The script has a built-in SSL certificate application function. To use this script to apply for a certificate, the following conditions must be met:

- Know the Cloudflare registered email
- Know the Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name has been resolved to the current server through cloudflare

How to get the Cloudflare Global API Key:
    ![](media/d13ffd6a73f938d1037d0708e31433bf.PNG)

When using, just enter `domain name`, `email`, `API KEY`, the diagram is as follows:

Precautions:

- The script uses DNS API for certificate request
- By default, Let'sEncrypt is used as the CA party
- The certificate installation directory is the /root/cert directory
- The certificates applied for by this script are all generic domain name certificates

## Tg Robot use (under development, temporarily unavailable)

> This function and tutorial are provided by [FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)

X-UI supports daily traffic notification, panel login reminder and other functions through Tg robot. To use Tg robot, you need to apply by yourself

Instructions for use: Set robot-related parameters in the background of the panel, including

- Tg Robot Token
- Tg Robot ChatId

Reference syntax:
- 30 * * * * * //Notification will be made at the 30s of each point
- @hourly      //hourly notification
